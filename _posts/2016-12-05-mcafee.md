# McAfee Virus Scan for Linux

**Vulnerability Writeup by Andrew Fasano**  
**December 12, 2016**

## Overview
A system running [Intel's McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/virusscan-enterprise-for-linux.aspx) can be compromised by remote attackers due to a number of security vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilities can be chained together to allow **[remote code execution as root](#root)**.

### Versions Affected
The vulnerabilities described here are present from at least v1.9.2 (released 2/19/2015) through version 2.0.2, (released 4/22/16). The only difference from the older release appears to be updating to a newer version of libc which makes exploiting these vulnerabilities easier.

## Intro
At a first glance, Intel's McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux has all the best characteristics that vulnerability researchers love: it runs as root, it claims to make your machine more secure, it's not particularly popular, and it looks like it hasn't been updated in a long time. When I noticed all these, I decided to take a look.

---

## System Architecture
Before getting into the details of the vulnerabilities in this product, it helps to have a quick understanding of the system architecture.

### Services
This product contains two separate services; one running as **root** and one running as an unprivileged user called **nails**. The main scanner service runs as **root** and listens on a local Unix socket at `/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/dev/nails_monitor`. The webserver runs as the **nails** user and listens on `0.0.0.0:55443`.

### Interprocess Communication
The webserver is essentially a UI on top of the scanner service. When a user makes a request to the webserver, the request is reformatted, sent to the root service and then the user is shown the response rendered in an html template. The web interface doesn't do much to limit what data a malicious user can send to the root service.

## Vulnerabilities
These ten vulnerabilities are described in this section:
1. [CVE-2016-8016: Remote Unauthenticated File Existence Test](#vuln1)
2. [CVE-2016-8017: Remote Unauthenticated File Read (with Constraints)](#vuln2)
3. [CVE-2016-8018: No Cross-Site Request Forgery Tokens](#vuln3)
4. [CVE-2016-8019: Cross Site Scripting](#vuln4)
5. [CVE-2016-8020: Authenticated Remote Code Execution & Privilege Escalation](#vuln5)
6. [CVE-2016-8021: Web Interface Allows Arbitrary File Write to Known Location](#vuln6)
7. [CVE-2016-8022: Remote Use of Authentication Tokens](#vuln7)
8. [CVE-2016-8023: Brute Force Authentication Tokens](#vuln8)
9. [CVE-2016-8024: HTTP Response Splitting](#vuln9)
10. [CVE-2016-8025: Authenticated SQL Injection](#vuln10)

When chained together, these vulnerabilities allow a **[remote attacker to execute code as root](#root)**.

---

### Vulnerability 1 (CVE-2016-8016): Remote Unauthenticated File Existence Test
![Burp Tasks HTML](/images/burp_tasks_html.png)

When browsing to many sections of the web interface, an html file path is specified in the `tplt` parameter, in the figure shown above `tplt` is set to tasks.html. Running strace on the webserver shows that this causes it to open `/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/apache/htdocs/0409/tasks.html` as shown here:
![Strace Open Tasks HTML](/images/strace_open_tasks_html.png)

If the `tplt` parameter is set to a different page, such as `..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd` (the string `../../../../../../etc/passwrd` urlencoded), the response is a badly formatted page with an error variable set to 14. The JavaScript function `lookupErrorCode` maps error 14 to the string "Badly Formed Web Template." If the `tplt` variable is set to a relative path that doesn't exist, the error variable is set to to 10 which corresponds to the string "cannot open file ".
![JS Bad Template vs File](/images/js_bad_template_vs_file.png)
![Strace No File vs File](/images/strace_no_file_vs_file.png)

The two different error messages can reveal to an unauthorized remote user if files by a given name exist on the system.

This leads to the question of what is different between the valid web templates (such as tasks.html) and invalid template files (such as /etc/passwd).

---

### Vulnerability 2 (CVE-2016-8017): Remote Unauthenticated File Read (with Constraints)
Looking at various template files used by the webserver, it's easy to see that valid template files either contain the magic string `__REPLACE_THIS__` or have the two tags `[%` and `%]` with any string between them.

If an attacker is able to place these strings into a file on the system (which may be trivial for log files), the attacker could then use the webserver to remotely read the entire file. A limitation of this vulnerability is that the files are being read by the **nails** user.

---

### Vulnerability 3 (CVE-2016-8018): No Cross-Site Request Forgery Tokens
There are no CSRF-tokens accompanying any forms on the web interface which allows attackers to submit authenticated requests when an authenticated user browsers to an attacker-controlled, external domain. Seeing this basic of a vulnerability in an AntiVirus product in 2016 is quite surprising. The lack of CSRF-tokens is one of the ways that a remote attacker can exploit a vulnerability that should only be exposed to authenticated users.

---

### Vulnerability 4 (CVE-2016-8019): Cross Site Scripting
When `tplt` is set to `NailsConfig.html` or `MonitorHost.html`, parameters `info:7` and `info:5` both place untrusted user input in a string being passed to the JavaScript function `formatData`. A typical value for `info:7` is a list of strings such as `single,show,serverUtcOffset=-25200`. This is then placed into a single-quoted string passed to `formatData`. If the `info:7` parameter is set to something like `single'.prototype.constructor=eval('alert("xss")')+`, the eval function will evaluate arbitrary malicious JavaScript before formatData is called.
![XSS Request](/images/xss_req.png)
This payload can then be modified to alert the message "xss".
![XSS Response](/images/xss_resp.png)

---

### Vulnerability 5 (CVE-2016-8020): Authenticated Remote Code Execution & Privilege Escalation
Starting a scan of the system requires filling out 4 pages worth of forms.
![Scan Step 1](/images/scan1.png)
![Scan Step 2](/images/scan2.png)
![Scan Step 3](/images/scan3.png)
![Scan Step 4](/images/scan4.png)

When the final page of the form is submitted, a large request is sent to the server. A subset of the parameters posted are shown here:
![Scan Properties](/images/scan_props2.png)

The `nailsd.profile.ODS_9.scannerPath` variable contains the path that the system will execute to run the scan. Modifying the value to `/bin/sh` generates the following error in the web interface:
![Command Inject Error](/images/cmd_inject_err.png)

Attaching strace shows that this parameter is passed directly to execve from a process running as **root**.
![Strace Execve](/images/strace_execve.png)

By changing this variable to an executable on the system, an authenticated user can have that binary executed by the root user. It would be easy to combine it with other XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities to exploit this without authentication.

This can't easily be extended into arbitrary code execution because there are multiple arguments passed to the binary. However, the `scannerPath` variable is not the only variable passed directly from the webserver to execve; while some values are hard-coded, four are entirely attacker-controlled leading to the following command:

```
[scannerPath] –e [enginePath] –D [datPath] –L [engineLibDir] –p 21 –i 2 –I 0
```

One vector to exploit this is through `/bin/sh` which will load a shell script specified by the `-e` argument and execute it. A local user could use this to escalate privileges, but a remote attacker would need a way to place a malicious shell script onto the system.

---

### Vulnerability 6 (CVE-2016-8021): Web Interface Allows Arbitrary File Write to Known Location
The web interface allows users to specify an update server and request updates from it. Since I wanted to find a way for a remote user to write a file to the system, this seemed like it might be a useful feature.

To find how the update server was used, I cloned McAfee's update repository locally and then reconfigure the server to download updates from my server.
![Repositories](/images/repos.png)

Two requests are made as part of the update process. First, there was a request to `/SiteStat.xml`, then a request to `/catalog.z`. The SiteStat file is just a standard XML file that says if a site is enabled and what version of the catalog it is serving. Presumably, an update will only be downloaded if this is newer than whatever version the application had last used to update. The `catalog.z` file looks like a [McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator file](http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/endpoint-protection/products/epolicy-orchestrator.aspx) which is mostly binary data. I made the choice to assume that this used good crypto and that the update was signed so there would be no way to push down a malicious update to compromise a system. Instead, I wanted to use this to push down a shell script to later execute with the previous vulnerability.

The log files claim that the update process consists of: downloading a file, verifying its integrity, unzipping, and installing.
![Downloading Update](/images/downloading_update.png)

Since this application isn't single-threaded, we can exploit this logic by making the program download a large file to `/opt/McAfee/cma/scratch/update/catalog.z`, and either before the download finishes or before the verification runs, we can use [Vulnerability 5](#vuln5) to execute it.

It's trivial to generate a shell script that will take a while to download, but will execute a given payload when run before the download is finished. This can be done by creating a script that contains a desired payload and then appending the payload with a large comment.

Combining vulnerabilities 5 and 6 now gives us a privilege escalation allowing us to go from the **nails** user to **root**. Using CSRF or XSS, it would be possible to use these vulnerabilities to remotely privesc to root.

---

### Vulnerability 7 (CVE-2016-8022): Remote Use of Authentication Tokens
In an attempt to develop an XSS and CSRF exploit, I threw together a simple cookie stealer and took a cookie from an authenticated user. But when I tried to use the cookie from my "attacker" machine, my authentication was denied:
![Bad Credentials](/images/bad_creds.png)

After confirming that the token worked on the original machine, I thought that the authentication tokens might be limited to a specific IP address. This would make writing an exploit more difficult, but it could still all be done via XSS using JavaScript in a victim's browser.

When a user authenticates through the website, a message is passed via a unix-socket to the root service. The root service validates the credentials and returns its results to the webserver. To find what was going wrong when a remote machine used my cookie, I used `socat` to man-in-the-middle the socket to see the messages.

This script restarts nails and intercepts all of its communications on the socket:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/AndrewFasano/582620995c948a9abdfd213ac1a85e71.js"></script>

Now we could see what was different between the two requests.

```


It looks like the webserver is sending the requester's IP address in addition to their cookie when it makes an AUTH request. Although it's a bit unusual, it's not a terrible security decision.

Our cookie is being sent via a text-based protocol and after our cookie, there's some number of spaces and the IP address. But if we modify this to make our cookie end with a space followed by the victim's IP address and then a number of spaces, it will be parsed incorrectly.

Instead of having the message sent on the socket be:

```
AUTH [cookie] [ATTACKER IP]
```

We'll modify our cookie so the message sent is:

```
AUTH [stolen cookie + VICTIM IP ] [ATTACKER IP]

```

The service incorrectly parses this line and believes that it's reading a cookie sent from the victim's IP address.

The full communication ends up looking like:

```
< 2015/07/30 11:14:28.119036 length=70 from=0 to=69
+OK welcome to the NAILS Monitor Service <19224.2214.1438280068.161>\r

```

### Vulnerability 8 (CVE-2016-8023): Brute Force Authentication Tokens
After seeing the previous cookie-parsing logic fail, I wanted to test how well the other cookie validation logic worked.

Here are a few sample values for the `nailsSessionId` cookies that were generated by logging in and out for the **nails** account:

```
127.0.0.1/nails/1459548338/1459548277-checksum//0
127.0.0.1/nails/1459549661/1459549629-checksum//0
127.0.0.1/nails/1459549695/1459549629-checksum//0
```

Only two parts of the cookie seem to change between typical login attempts. The cookie format seems to be:
```
[host]/[username]/[SECRET1]/[SECRET2]-checksum//[Zero]
```

Where typical values are as follow:

| Variable   | Description                                   | Observed Values           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [host]     | An IP Address                                 | 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1      |
| [username] | The username of the logged-in user.           | nails                     |
| [SECRET1]  | Unix time at which the cookie was assigned    | 1435067777                |
| [SECRET2]  | Unix time at which the server was started     | 1435066996                |
| [Zero]     | The number 0                                  | 0                         |

While using a timestamp for a secret value is a bad idea since it could be brute-forced, using two in conjunction would normally make this difficult. Fortunately, that's not the case here. Some basic testing found that the acceptable values for these fields differed significantly from what they were typically set to:

| Variable   | Acceptable Value                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| [host]     | IP address request is sent from         |
| [username] | Any string                              |
| [SECRET1]  | Any number                              |
| [SECRET2]  | Unix time at which the server was started |
| [Zero]     | Blank                                   |

This leaves us with one value to brute-force; the time at which the server was started at. Starting at the current date and decrementing it until we've successfully authenticated can be done by modifying the `DATE` value in the following cookie:


```
[Attacker IP]/n/0/[DATE]-checksum//

```

### Vulnerability 9 (CVE-2016-8024): HTTP Response Splitting
Users can export a CSV of all log data from the "System Events" page by clicking an export button which just makes a GET request.
![Export CSV](/images/export_csv.png)

When this request is sent, one of the parameters is `info%3A0`. This parameter typically holds the value `multi%2Capplication%2Fvnd.ms-excel`. The server responds to this request with a header `Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel`. An attacker can create a link that responds with arbitrary headers by simply URL encoding newlines plus additional headers.

![Splitting Response](/images/splitting_resp.png)

---

### Vulnerability 10 (CVE-2016-8025): Authenticated SQL Injection
This system uses a SQLite database to store data about settings and previous scans. Every entry point to this database I looked at was vulnerable to SQL injections. This application appears to translate URL arguments into SQLite commands. Using the CSV-export function mentioned in the discussion of vulnerability 9, we can dump the `sqlite_master` table in CSV form simply by visiting a URL. The query `select * from sqlite_master;` is embedded in the URL:

```
localhost:55443/0409/nails?pg=proxy&tplt=-&addr=127.0.0.1%3A65443&mon%3A0=db+select+_show%3D%24*++_output%3Dcsv+_table%3Dsqlite_master+&info%3A0=multi%2Capplication%2Fvnd.ms-excel
```


![SQL DB](/images/sql_db.png)

The database isn't used for authentication, just to track which files have been scanned and the event log. After exploiting other vulnerabilities to compromise a machine, an attacker could use SQL injections to modify the event log to clean up their tracks.

The schema of this database is:
```sql

### Bringing it all Together: Remote Code Execution as Root
To execute code as the root user on a remote machine:
1. Brute force authentication token using [Vulnerability 7](#vuln7) and [Vulnerability 8](#vuln8).
2. Start running a malicious update server.
3. Send request with authentication token to update the update server using [Vulnerability 7](#vuln7).
4. Force target to create a malicious script on their system using [Vulnerability 6](#vuln6).
5. Send malformed request with authentication token to start virus scan but execute malicious script instead by using [Vulnerability 5](#vuln5) and [Vulnerability 6](#vuln6).
6. The malicious script is then run by the root user on the victim machine.

*Exploiting this vulnerability depends on the existence of a valid login token which is generated whenever a user logs into the web interface. These tokens are valid for approximately an hour after login.*
